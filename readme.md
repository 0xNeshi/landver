# LandVer - Land Verification System

LandVer is a decentralized protocol for land registration and verification, utilizing blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and immutable system for managing land records. The protocol facilitates land transactions and ownership verification across multiple blockchains, beginning with StarkNet.

While initially built on StarkNet, LandVer is designed to be cross-chain compatible, allowing land transactions and records to be securely managed across multiple blockchains. LandVer is one of the many products of Noshon Networks, which aims to bring innovation to the world of real estate.

## Roadmap
- Cross-Chain Support: Extend the protocol to support Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and other blockchains.
- Advanced Land Disputes Resolution: Implement on-chain dispute resolution mechanisms.
- Tokenized Land Ownership: Explore integration with NFTs for land tokenization.
